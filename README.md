# Prime
This is a simple project in ASP.NET
I tried to combine the efficiency and perfomance of C++ with theb ASP.NET framework to generate prime numbers less than a number in the most efficient way in a webpage.
1) input is taken from the user form
2) the input is passed to a .exe file made with C++ using the most efficient prime numbers generation algorithm Sieve of Eratosthenes
3) the output of the .exe file is written in a text file
RQ : the printing to file is executed only one time cause the output is first concatenated to string cause writing to the string is more efficient than writing to 
a file than that string is printed to the file.
4) the text file is printed to the user
